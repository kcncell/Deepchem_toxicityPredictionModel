# Deepchem_toxicityPredictionModel
 This is a introductory deep learning model which uses the Deepchem package. Lots of credit has to be given to the authors(Ramsundar B., Eastman P., Walters P., Pande V.) of the book "Deep Learning for the Life Sciences". This book has been a gold mine in terms of my exploration and journey in DeepLearning in the field of biochemistry.
